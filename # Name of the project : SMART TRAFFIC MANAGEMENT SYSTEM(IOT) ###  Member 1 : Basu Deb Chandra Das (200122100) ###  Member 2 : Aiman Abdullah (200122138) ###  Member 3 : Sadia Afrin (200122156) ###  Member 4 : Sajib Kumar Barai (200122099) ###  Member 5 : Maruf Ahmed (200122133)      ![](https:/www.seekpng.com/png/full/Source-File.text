\begin{abstract}
Traffic Management is an issue which impacts us almost daily. Use of technology and
real time analysis can actually lead to a smooth traffic management. The common
reason for traffic congestion is due to poor traffic prioritization. Let us take the
scenario of Bangladesh. It is 1
st most populous city of Dhaka. While the number of
vehicles are increasing at a fast pace, the infrastructure in the city is not being able
to match this growth. However, our solution to this problem is not limited to the Dhaka
city only.

\section{Introduction}
It can be used for other urban cities as well where traffic jams during rush
hours are becoming a routine affair, especially in the internal sectors where long
queues of vehicles can be seen stranded. Therefore, we have tried to address the
problem with the help of our project wherein the focus would be to minimize the
vehicular congestion. We have achieved this with the help of image processing that
can be obtained from surveillance cameras and eventually to deploy a feedback
mechanism in the working of the traffic lights where the density of the traffic would
also be factored in the decision making process. 

\section{ANALYSIS/ RESEARCH ON WHY PROBLEM EXISTS}

\subsection{The main reasons for traffic congestion and delay are analysed as follows:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Poor Traffic Management
\item Lesser use of automated techniques
\item More number of Vehicles
\item Unrestrained demand
\item Insufficient Capacity
\item Large Red Light Delays
\end{itemize}
\section{Intelligent Traffic Management System}
The government is trying its best to ensure swift movement of traffic on roads
by constructing wider roads, flyovers, underpasses and expressways etc. But,
giving wider roads to the burgeoning number of vehicles is not enough. You
must ensure safety on roads along with traffic management and it can better
be achieved by Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS).

\subsection{Existing System:}\label{AA}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is Difficult to identify the Traffic Violators
\item There is no IOT based Traffic management System.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Proposed System:}
\begin{itemize}
\item  IOT based traffic management
 \item Easy to find the path for emergency condition
in ambulance.
\item The Traffic violators are captured and send to
Police.
\item Can be used anywhere,
\item No need of human power to
identify violators during night

\end{itemize}

\subsection{ANALYSIS/ RESEARCH ON WHY PROBLEM EXISTS.}
After doing extensive research, we reached the conclusion that there are
several drawbacks of earlier methods - Wastage of time by lighting green
signal even when road is empty. Image processing removes such problem.
Slight difficult to implement in real time because the accuracy of time
calculation depends on relative position of camera. This project provides a
solution to reduce traffic congestion on roads overriding the older system of
hard coded lights which cause unwanted delays. Reducing congestion and
waiting time will lessen the number of accidents and also reduces fuel
consumption which in turn will help in controlling the air pollution. This will also
provide data for future road design and construction or where improvements
are required and which are urgent like which junction has higher waiting
times.

a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Varied hardware devices are installed to collect data from different sources.
This hardware includes automatic vehicle identifiers, sensors, camera, and
GPS based automatic vehicle locators etc. The received data such as traffic
count, travel speed, vehicle weight, surveillance, and delays etc. is forwarded
to the master controller.

\subsection{Number Plate Detection}

The objective of the research paper is to capture the design a Vehicle
Number Plate Identification System which can be used to identify
and read the license number of any vehicle. The basic process involves taking
the image of the front/rear of the vehicle which then gets
processed and ultimately the number gets displayed on the LCD.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Data transmission}
\textbf{Rapid and real-time information is collected and forwarded to the users.} Rapid and real-time information is collected and forwarded to the users. The
information is analysed and used to make traffic related announcements to
the travellers through the internet, SMS, or on-board units of the vehicle.


\section*{METHODOLOGY}

The cloud contains all the information in the database which has information
like users, vehicles, Traffic offences, Safe limitfor each Road, Locations of each
vehicles and roads etc. The network of these Vehicles is stored to identify and
authorize and also track their features like conditions, driving range, max
speed, safety measures etc. The officials are given premium benefits to
monitor the vehicle registrations, available users, incoming applications, traffic
violence and offence, and traffic flow. These officials can access and modify
the blockage of routes in case of a VIP patrol or any other unavoidable
closures in the road and the users can choose an alternate route
